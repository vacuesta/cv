          <h2>Mario Kart: A Study of Image formation and total Internal Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            In Mario Kart 8, characters race through underwater tracks, yet, objects above the water line appear to be exactly where they would beâ€”as if interference of light between water and air did not exist. We present a lesson where we ask
            students to predict what a racer would see based on the physics they have learned, then assist them through a discovery process using ray tracing. Finally, demonstrating refractive principles with a submerged GoPro camera. Guided by these
            steps, we show how underwater images can be used to determine the critical angle of water and its index of refraction, thus developing a fuller appreciation for underwater banana peels. <span class="emph">This project was published in the
              American Association of Physics Teachers in the November 2018 journal.</span>

          <h2>Dirichlet-Multinomial Bayes Classifier</h2>
          <p>
            Bayesian classifiers were developed to predict microbial compositions that are associated with disease. The algorithm uses a traning data set to define the parameters then a test dataset to analze against the trained data. Utilized
            sub-processes to wrap R based algorithms to be called in python. Utilized python flask for web development and this site is to be deployed on an apache server. The purpose for this web application was for scientists to upload test data in
            order output information on the type of microorganisms involved with their test data.

          <h2>Neural Network: Dog & Cat Classifier</h2>
          <p>Deep learning is a way to train the computer to compute a particular output based on training a neural network through a particular data set. A neural network is implemented with hidden layers along with an activation function and cost
            function to be able to train data for the machine to learn. Feed forwarding and backpropagation are important topics in deep learning in order for the machine to learn and fix themselves when mistakes are made through outputs made on the
            dataset. One developed program, cnn.ipynb, can read through a multitude of images consisting of cats and dogs and accurately predict a test sample at 82%. The other developed program, digit- classification.ipynb, can read through a
            multitude of images consisting of hand-drawn digits and accurately predict a test sample at 97%. Both programs are paradigms of deep learning that can be used in situations that when either program is given a large data set of dogs and
            cats or images of digits, the computer will be able to predict the outcome of what a test sample data set is.</p>

          <h2>Random Forest Model for Breast Cancer classification</h2>
          <p>Program is written in R, creating statistical models on data sets from the UCI dataset repository. My project involved creating a random forest model and implementing a K-Nearest Neighbor machine learning algorithms on a dataset that
            involves breast cancer for classification. The random forest model had higher accuracy on the test data-set compared to k-NN. This program imputed missing data that was missing.

          <h2>Computational Biology Pipeline</h2>
          <p>Automate the process of taking in illumina reads through a wget file, spades to assemble the genome, prokka to annotate, then utilize bowtie2 to index the reads then tophat and cufflinks to map the reads. There are subsequent steps in
            the assignment to ask for specific outputs from the file such as reads that are '> 1000'. Everything will be written into a log file that is stated. The automation of this is done using a python wrapper that imports os module in order to
            call the command lines within the python script.
